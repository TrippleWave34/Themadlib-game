<p>
    Once upon a time, in the kingdom of <input type="text" name="kingdom" placeholder="what kingdom"> 
    there ruled a king named Henry the VIII, who was known for his <input type="text" name="adjective" placeholder="give an adjective"> appetite for both <input type="text" name="feast">and <input type="text" name="wives"> 

Henry had <input type="text" name="number"> wives, which made his love life more dramatic than a <input type="text" name="genre"> novel. His first wife, Catherine of <input type="text" name="place">, couldn't give him a <input type="text" name="noun">, so he decided to <input type="text" name="verb" placeholder="what action was taken"> her. But the Pope said “(exclamation)!”, which made Henry so <input type="text" name="emotional"> that he created the <input type="text" name="church" name="church">Church. </p>

<p>
    He later married <input type="text" name="femaleName" placeholder="female name">, who gave birth to <input type="text" name="child" placeholder="(historical figure)">
    
 Sadly, things didn't end well for her—Henry had her <input type="text" name="ViolentVerb">. After that, he married again. And again. And again... until people started calling him <input type="text" name="nickname" placeholder=" funny nickname"> behind his back.

 Henry was also famous for changing England's <input type="text" name="noun2"> forever and eating <input type="text" name="typeOfFood"> until his <input type="text" name="bodyPart" placeholder="bodypart"> was the size of a <input type="text" name="Object" placeholder="large object">.
</p>
<p>
    By the time he died in <input type="text" name="year" placeholder="year of death">, Henry had turned England upside down, started a new <input type="text" name="trend" placeholder="fashion trend">, and left behind a royal mess for his children to clean up.
